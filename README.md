# Generic Context Guide

I put off trying to learn much about LLMs and to use them at a surface level for the bulk of my beginning journey into Tech.
This is a guide that was started as a way to help me understand how to use LLMs with context.md files.

I think as I built my personal guide and context files, I certainly learned things along the way.
Sometimes about how I work, how I think about things, or how my brain categorizes stuff.

Isn't that what personal projects are supposed to be used for in the tech world?

I probably made a mistake by using Claude and GPT to teach me along side their own documentation.
`“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself.” - R. Feynman` :/

... But these LLMs are pretty dang good at figuring us out if we feed them enough information.
This was most-definitely written with the help of `Claude` and a little bit of `GPT-5.2`.

Sorry, but I didn't start this stuff during the age of learn-this-shit-on-your-own.
I think that I wish I did, but my cardboard box does not say time machine.

Please help me #gitgood by collaborating or contributing.
Hell, tell me there's a better way, if that's all you want to do.
