Based on our complete conversation history, generate 5 separate, modular markdown files optimized for cloud-hosted LLM context (Claude, ChatGPT):

1. **cs-engineering-context.md** - My software engineering projects from the past as I am not currently working on any active develpment, Programming Language Competency, ownership patterns, MIDI automation tool plans

2. **it-sysadmin-context.md** - My IT role, Git repository governance work, Windows Server work, enterprise repo architecture, PowerShell automation preferences

3. **audio-studio-context.md** - My complete studio hardware inventory, QU-5D routing template, DAW workflows, monitoring chain, MIDI utilities, patchbay setup, plugin preferences and usages of VSTs

4. **home-network-context.md** - YelNet topology, Unifi Devices and topology, Reolink camera system, UniFi migration plans, segmentation goals and future Homelab ideas.

5. **active-projects-context.md** - Implementing a Git Repository for Work on our locally hosted Domain Controller, Doomscroller film, Louis art installation (data privacy/WiFi VLAN project), MIDI mapping tool, HomeLab building for a home hacking learning environment,

Requirements for each file:
- Maximum 1,000 words each
- Use tables for inventories (not prose lists)
- Include "Last Updated" date at top
- Mark UNKNOWN items explicitly
- Focus on facts that change my interaction with an LLM (not static reference data)
- Optimize for selective loading (I should be able to paste just ONE file when relevant)


# cs-engineering-context.md
---
Based on our complete conversation history, generate a "cs-engineering-competency.md" file optimized for cloud-hosted LLM context (Claude, ChatGPT).

Structure it in THREE sections:

## 1) Demonstrated Competencies (What I've Proven I Understand)
Extract competency signals from my past projects (Contra SDL2 game, etc.) to show:
- Languages I'm proficient in (C++, Java, Python, PowerShell) with evidence
- CS fundamentals I've demonstrated (OOP, memory management, ownership patterns, factories, smart pointers)
- Design patterns I've successfully applied (Factory pattern, composition over inheritance, etc.)
- Development practices I follow (code style preferences, debugging methodology, testing awareness)
- Learning style patterns (how I approach new concepts, preference for understanding over cargo-culting)

## 2) Knowledge Gaps & Growth Areas (What I Want/Need to Learn)
Identify areas where I've asked questions or shown interest but lack depth:
- Advanced C++ & other Languagetopics I haven't mastered yet
- Software architecture patterns I should learn
- Testing/CI-CD practices I haven't implemented
- Performance optimization techniques
- Concurrency/multithreading (if relevant)
- Modern tooling I should adopt

## 3) Active Learning Context (What I'm Currently Focused On)
- Current language/framework priorities
- Immediate skill-building goals
- Projects that represent my current trajectory (not old coursework)

Requirements:
- Maximum 800 words
- Use tables where appropriate (e.g., "Language Proficiency Matrix")
- Mark learning gaps as "TARGET SKILL" so the LLM knows to teach, not assume
- Include "Last Updated" date
- Focus on TRANSFERABLE competencies, not project-specific details
